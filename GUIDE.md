## Quick Start

**vikunja-mcp** transforms your existing Vikunja task manager into an AI-powered productivity system. It learns your energy patterns, suggests optimal tasks for your current state, and helps you maintain focus through intelligent recommendations.

### What Makes This Different?
- **Energy-Aware**: Matches tasks to your current mental capacity
- **Context-Smart**: Reduces decision paralysis with AI recommendations  
- **ADHD-Optimized**: Built specifically for neurodivergent productivity patterns
- **Non-Disruptive**: Works with your existing Vikunja setup without migration

### Prerequisites
- Active Vikunja instance (self-hosted or cloud)
- OpenAI API key for intelligent recommendations
- Claude AI access (via this interface)

---

## Understanding the System

### Architecture Overview
```
You â†” Claude AI â†” vikunja-mcp â†” OpenAI GPT-4 â†” Your Vikunja Tasks
```

**What happens when you ask for recommendations:**
1. You describe your current state ("I have 2 hours, medium energy, need to do deep work")
2. Claude passes this to vikunja-mcp
3. vikunja-mcp fetches your tasks from Vikunja
4. OpenAI analyzes tasks and suggests the best matches
5. You get a curated list optimized for your current capacity

### Key Concepts

**Energy Levels:**
- **Low**: Simple, routine tasks that don't require deep thinking
- **Medium**: Moderate complexity work, administrative tasks
- **High**: Complex problem-solving, creative work, challenging projects
- **Social**: Communication, meetings, collaborative work

**Work Modes:**
- **Deep**: Sustained focus on complex, important work
- **Quick**: Short bursts of productive action (5-25 minutes)
- **Admin**: Organizational tasks, email, planning, maintenance

**Hyperfocus Compatibility (1-5 scale):**
- **1-2**: Light tasks, good for warm-up or cool-down
- **3**: Balanced tasks suitable for most sessions
- **4-5**: Prime hyperfocus material, save for peak energy

## Setup & Configuration

### Option 1: Docker Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
# Pull and run the container
docker run -d \
  --name vikunja-mcp \
  -e VIKUNJA_URL="https://your-vikunja-instance.com" \
  -e VIKUNJA_TOKEN="your-vikunja-api-token" \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key" \
  vikunja-mcp:latest

# Check if container is running
docker ps | grep vikunja-mcp
docker logs vikunja-mcp
```

### Option 2: Local Development

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/BelKirill/vikunja-mcp.git
cd vikunja-mcp
make build

# Set environment variables
export VIKUNJA_URL="https://your-vikunja-instance.com"
export VIKUNJA_TOKEN="your-vikunja-api-token" 
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"

# Run the MCP server
./bin/mcp
```

### Getting Your Vikunja API Token

1. Log into your Vikunja instance
2. Go to Settings â†’ API Tokens
3. Create a new token with full access
4. Copy the token for your environment variables

### Connecting to Claude

Once your vikunja-mcp server is running, it automatically becomes available as MCP tools in this Claude interface. The MCP tools will appear and you can start using commands like:

```
I have 3 hours, high energy, want to do deep work. What should I focus on?
```

**Note**: The MCP server runs as a background process that Claude connects to via the MCP protocol, not as a web service.

## Core Features & Tools

### 1. `daily-focus` - Your AI Productivity Assistant

**Purpose**: Get personalized task recommendations based on your current state

**Usage:**
```
I have 3 hours, high energy, want to do deep work. What should I focus on?
```

**Parameters:**
- **energy**: `low|medium|high|social` - Your current mental capacity
- **mode**: `deep|quick|admin` - Type of work you want to do
- **hours**: Available time (0.1 to 8 hours)
- **max_items**: Number of tasks to recommend (default: 5)
- **instructions**: Special preferences or constraints

**Example Output:**
```
ðŸŽ¯ AI Recommendations for Deep Work (High Energy, 3 hours)

1. **Refactor authentication system** (Hyperfocus: 5/5)
   - Perfect for high-energy deep work
   - Estimated: 2.5 hours
   - Why: Complex problem-solving matches your peak capacity

2. **Write technical architecture doc** (Hyperfocus: 4/5)
   - High-value documentation work
   - Estimated: 2 hours
   - Why: Creative writing task suited for focused sessions
```

### 2. `upsert-task` - Intelligent Task Creation

**Purpose**: Create or update tasks with rich metadata for better AI recommendations

**Usage:**
```
Create a task: "Review Q3 budget analysis" - this is admin work, medium priority, should take about 1 hour
```

**Parameters:**
- **title**: Task name
- **description**: Detailed description (metadata will be embedded here)
- **priority**: 1-5 (1=highest, 5=lowest)
- **project_id**: Vikunja project ID
- **metadata**: Energy level, work mode, duration, hyperfocus rating

**The AI automatically adds metadata like:**
```json
{
  "energy": "medium",
  "mode": "admin", 
  "minutes": 60,
  "hyper_focus_comp": 3
}
```

### 3. `get-filtered-tasks` - Smart Task Discovery

**Purpose**: Find tasks using natural language or specific filters

**Natural Language Examples:**
```
Show me quick tasks I can do in 15 minutes
Find high-priority tasks for deep work
What admin tasks are overdue?
Show me creative projects I've been avoiding
List tasks with priority 1-2 in my current project
Find all tasks tagged "urgent" that aren't done
Show me tasks created this week that need review
```

**Manual Filter Examples (Working Vikunja Syntax):**
```
# High-priority incomplete tasks (priorities 1-2, with 1 being highest)
priority <= 2 && done = false

# All incomplete tasks (basic productivity filter)
done = false

# Recent tasks (this week)
created >= "2025-06-17" && done = false

# Time-based filtering (specific date ranges)
updated >= "2025-06-01" && updated <= "2025-06-23" && done = false

# Urgent incomplete tasks by priority
priority = 1 && done = false

# Medium to high priority tasks
priority <= 3 && done = false

# Recently created high-priority tasks
created >= "2025-06-20" && priority <= 2

# Complex filtering (high priority OR recent updates)
(priority <= 2 || updated >= "2025-06-20") && done = false
```

**Filter Tips:**
- **Priority**: Lower numbers = higher priority (1 = highest, 5 = lowest)
- **Dates**: Use YYYY-MM-DD format in quotes
- **Status**: `done = false` for incomplete, `done = true` for completed
- **Operators**: `>=` (greater/equal), `<=` (less/equal), `=` (equals), `!=` (not equals)
- **Logic**: `&&` (and), `||` (or), parentheses for grouping

### 4. `get-full-task` - Detailed Task Analysis

**Purpose**: Get complete information about a specific task including metadata

**Usage:**
```
Show me details for task ID 1234
```

**Returns:**
- Full task description
- Embedded metadata (energy, mode, duration)
- Creation/update timestamps
- Project context
- Priority and status

### 5. `add-comment` - Task Progress Tracking

**Purpose**: Add timestamped comments to track progress or insights

**Usage:**
```
Add comment to task 1234: "Completed first draft, needs peer review before finalizing"
```

## Daily Workflow Examples

### Morning Planning Session

```
ðŸŒ… MORNING ROUTINE

You: "I have 4 hours today, feeling medium energy, mix of deep work and admin. What should I tackle?"

Claude: [Uses daily-focus to analyze your tasks]

Response: "Here's your optimized day:
â€¢ 9-11am: Deep work on customer dashboard (High focus needed)
â€¢ 11-11:30am: Quick admin - expense reports (Low energy OK) 
â€¢ 11:30am-12:30pm: Review and respond to client emails (Medium energy)
â€¢ 1:30-2:30pm: Admin time - project planning for next week"
```

### Mid-Day Energy Check

```
âš¡ ENERGY SHIFT

You: "My energy crashed after lunch. Show me low-energy tasks for the next hour."

Claude: [Filters for low-energy, quick tasks]

Response: "Perfect for a post-lunch dip:
â€¢ Organize project files (15 min)
â€¢ Update task priorities (10 min)
â€¢ Review calendar for tomorrow (5 min)
â€¢ Clean up email inbox (20 min)"
```

### End-of-Day Capture

```
ðŸŒ™ DAILY WRAP-UP

You: "Create tasks for tomorrow: 'Prepare presentation slides' (2 hours, deep work) and 'Call vendor about pricing' (15 min admin)"

Claude: [Creates tasks with appropriate metadata]

Response: "Tasks created with optimal scheduling data:
â€¢ Presentation slides â†’ Tagged for high-energy deep work sessions
â€¢ Vendor call â†’ Flagged as quick admin task for low-energy periods"
```

### Manual Weekly Review (Current Approach)

```
ðŸ“Š PATTERN ANALYSIS

You: "Show me all tasks I completed this week"
Claude: [Uses get-filtered-tasks with date range and done=true]

You: "What high-priority tasks did I avoid this week?"
Claude: [Uses get-filtered-tasks with priority filters and done=false]

You: "Show me tasks I created but haven't started"
Claude: [Uses get-filtered-tasks with creation date filters]

// Note: This is manual analysis. A dedicated weekly-review tool 
// would automate this pattern analysis and provide insights.
```

## Advanced Usage Patterns

### Energy-Based Batching

**Concept**: Group similar tasks by energy requirement for better flow

```
# High Energy Blocks (90-120 minutes)
- Complex problem solving
- Creative work
- Learning new concepts
- Difficult conversations

# Medium Energy Blocks (25-60 minutes)  
- Writing and documentation
- Code reviews
- Planning and strategy
- Routine development work

# Low Energy Blocks (5-25 minutes)
- Email and communication
- File organization
- Simple data entry
- Meeting preparation
```

### Hyperfocus Session Planning

**When you feel hyperfocus coming on:**

```
You: "I'm feeling hyperfocused and have 3 hours. What's the highest-value work I can do?"

Claude: [Identifies tasks with hyperfocus rating 4-5]

Response: "Hyperfocus session optimized:
1. **Architect new feature** (5/5 rating) - Perfect complex challenge
2. **Write technical deep-dive** (4/5 rating) - Creative writing flow
3. Backup: **Debug performance issue** (4/5 rating) - If you finish early"
```

### Context Switching Minimization

**Stay within project boundaries:**

```
You: "I'm working on the mobile app project. Keep me focused there for the next 2 hours."

Claude: [Filters to mobile app project only]

Response: "Mobile app focus session:
â€¢ UI component implementation (Deep work, 90 min)
â€¢ Update mobile app documentation (Medium work, 30 min)
â€¢ Test on different devices (Quick tasks, 20 min total)"
```

### Procrastination Intervention

**When avoiding important work:**

```
You: "I keep avoiding the quarterly report. It's due Friday and I'm stressed about it."

Claude: [Suggests task breakdown and energy matching]

Response: "Let's break this down:
â€¢ Start with outline (15 min, low energy) - Less intimidating entry point
â€¢ Draft financial section (45 min, medium energy) - Use existing data
â€¢ Write executive summary (30 min, high energy) - Save creative work for peak
â€¢ Review and polish (20 min, medium energy) - Final details

Start with the outline right now - just 15 minutes to reduce anxiety."
```

## Tips for ADHD Users

### Working WITH Your Brain, Not Against It

**Embrace Natural Rhythms:**
- Track your energy patterns for 1-2 weeks
- Schedule demanding work during your peak hours
- Use low-energy periods for routine tasks
- Don't fight your natural flow

**Reduce Decision Fatigue:**
- Let the AI choose your next task
- Batch similar decisions together
- Pre-plan your week during high-energy periods
- Create "default" routines for common scenarios

**Manage Hyperfocus:**
- Always have backup tasks ready (rating 4-5)
- Set gentle alerts for breaks (but don't force them)
- Keep water and snacks nearby
- Note what triggers hyperfocus for future planning

**Handle Overwhelm:**
- Start with quick wins (5-15 minute tasks)
- Break large projects into smaller pieces
- Use the "minimum viable progress" approach
- Celebrate small accomplishments

### Pomodoro Optimization

**Traditional Pomodoro**: 25 min work, 5 min break
**ADHD-Optimized Pomodoro**: 
- Start with 15-25 minutes (based on task complexity)
- Extend naturally if in flow (don't force breaks)
- Take longer breaks when energy is low
- Use breaks for movement, not more mental work

### Emergency Protocols

**When Everything Feels Urgent:**
```
1. Brain dump all tasks (don't organize yet)
2. Ask AI: "Help me prioritize this chaos"
3. Pick ONE task to do right now
4. Set a 25-minute timer
5. Ignore everything else until timer goes off
```

**When Motivation is Zero:**
```
1. Ask for 5-minute tasks only
2. Do just one thing
3. Use completion dopamine to build momentum
4. Gradually increase task difficulty
5. Celebrate every small win
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"AI recommendations don't match my preferences"**
- Update task metadata to better reflect actual energy/time requirements
- Use the `instructions` parameter to specify preferences
- Track which recommendations work and adjust task descriptions

**"Tasks aren't showing up in recommendations"**
- Check that tasks have proper metadata embedded
- Verify task status (completed tasks are filtered out)
- Ensure project_id matches if filtering by project

**"System feels overwhelming instead of helpful"**
- Start with fewer recommendations (max_items: 2-3)
- Focus on one work mode at a time
- Use shorter time blocks (1-2 hours maximum)

**"Energy levels don't seem accurate"**
- Energy is subjective and changes throughout the day
- Start with your best guess and adjust based on results
- Track patterns: what types of work feel energizing vs. draining?

### Technical Issues

**Connection Problems:**
```bash
# Check if MCP server is running
docker ps | grep vikunja-mcp
# or for local development:
ps aux | grep mcp

# Check MCP server logs
docker logs vikunja-mcp

# Verify environment variables are set
docker exec vikunja-mcp env | grep -E "(VIKUNJA|OPENAI)"
```

**Slow AI Responses:**
- OpenAI API calls typically take 2-3 seconds
- Reduce max_items if recommendations are too slow
- Check your OpenAI API rate limits
- MCP protocol adds minimal overhead to AI processing
